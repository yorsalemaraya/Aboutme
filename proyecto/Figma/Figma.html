<h3>About me</h3>

<p>Hey, I am Yorsa !</p>
<p>I was born and raised in France, but originally Eritrean. I graduated from a BSc in International Business, majoring in marketing in France. These studies allowed me to enrich myself 
  internationally, to have the opportunity to work on various projects in a group and to gain professionalism to work in a company. I did my internship in Valencia, Spain as a web project manager, and I worked in customers/partner relations in different companies in Barcelona and Valencia. 
</p>

<p>I am currently studying webdesign at ESAT, Valencia, Spain, in order to become a UX/UI designer. Aware of the impact of technology in our society and the importance of developing a professional activity through digital content, I naturally turned to this sector.
